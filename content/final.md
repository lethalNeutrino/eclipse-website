# Eclipse Rendering
## Aditya Baireddy, Andrew Liu, Andy Chen, Eddie Park

### Summary
For our project, we are aiming to realistically render a Sun-and-Moon system to simulate an eclipse. At the halfway point of the project, we present some preliminary results, as well as a reflection and update to the proposed project timeline.

### Accomplishments
So far, we've finished all of the portions of the project we planned to in our proposal.
These include:
- Setting up the application through Unity
- Implementing an interactive camera system with panning
- Rendering spheres (done through Unity's built-in rendering)
- Perlin and fractal noise functions to simulate the Sun's surface
- Blackbody radiation to find the correct star color based on temperature
- A basic rendering of the star's corona 
### Preliminary results

Here is a short video of a rendering of our sun:
